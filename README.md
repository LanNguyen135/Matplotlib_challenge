### Overview

This repository contains the analysis of a research study involving the treatment of SCC tumors in mice with various drug regimens. The primary focus was on comparing the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment options. The data was processed, visualized, and analyzed to derive meaningful insights into the tumor response and the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.

### Data Cleaning
- Duplicate entries were removed to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

### Summary Statistics
- Summary statistics were computed to provide an overview of the data.
- Measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values were calculated.

### Data Visualization
Several visualizations were created to better understand the data:
- Bar Chart:
  - A bar chart was generated to visualize the number of observations for each drug regimen.
  - This chart helps to identify the drugs with the highest number of data points.

- Pie Chart:
  - A pie chart was created to visualize the gender distribution of the mice in the study.
  - The chart presents the proportion of male and female mice in the dataset.

- Box Plots:
  - Box plots were plotted to identify potential outliers and distribution characteristics of tumor sizes for each drug regimen.
  - These visualizations provide a clear comparison of the effectiveness of different treatments.

- Line Plot:
  - A line plot was created to illustrate the change in tumor size over 45 days for mice receiving the Capomulin drug regimen.
  - This plot demonstrates the tumor response to the treatment over time.

- Scatter Plot:
  - A scatter plot was generated to explore the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment group.
  - Additionally, a linear regression line was added to observe the trend more clearly.

Quartiles and Outliers
- Quartiles were calculated to understand the distribution of tumor sizes within each drug regimen.
- Outliers were identified and marked for further analysis.

Correlation and Linear Regression
- The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment group was calculated.
- A linear regression line was added to the scatter plot to visualize the strength and direction of the relationship.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the SCC tumor treatment study revealed valuable insights into the efficacy of various drug regimens. Capomulin and Ramicane emerged as the most promising treatments, showing significant reductions in tumor size compared to others. Additionally, the strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume suggests a possible relationship between these variables.

The data cleaning, processing, and visualization techniques applied in this analysis help present a comprehensive understanding of the research findings and provide a foundation for further investigation.
